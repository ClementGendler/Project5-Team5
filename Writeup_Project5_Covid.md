# Problem Statement

Identify potential Covid hotspots at the US state level, specifically predict CASES based on government response, mobility, and population data, even weather.

Data sets we will use:  
- Covid19 database on GitHub - https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data
- Shape files from US Census
- Facebook posts

# Data Description and Data Dictionary

For data collection, we used selected several fields available from the Covid 19 Open Data site.  Of the 108 fields offered, we honed in on the fields listed in the data dictionary below.   

| Item | Description | Original Source |

We used data from Covid 19 Open Data site, which compiles data for countries world wide, including select provinces such as US states. DEtails on this data source are below"

}

To supplement our quantitative data, we utilized posts from Facebook to understand if they serve as leading indicator of infection.  
- how were the FB posts collected (API?)
- parameters and other pre-processing steps
- how incorporated into modeling visualization

### Quantitative Modeling for Prediction

For the first pass, we created a rough model assess how well the data would predict, as well as which type of classifier would work best.
