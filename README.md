# Problem Statement #
This study utilizes Covid19 daily data on confimed cases, population, weather, and Covid-related search activity to create a model which predicts future Covied19 hotspots.

# Executive Summary #
This study utilizes Covid19 daily data on confimed cases, population, weather, and Covid-related search activity to create a model which predicts future Covied19 hotspots.  The breadth of the data (over 6 months of daily data for 50 US states) introduces a not-inconsequential amount of complexity.  After testing SARIMA and ARIMA models, we tried two additional models:  Facebook Prophet, and "IID" Model.  Ultimately, we determined that the IID Model yielded the most specific predictions, as it allowed us to fit models specific to each state.  Our docuementation includes heatmaps which visualize for the reader the difference in predictions.
